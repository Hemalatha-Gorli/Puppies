                            total of 15 minutes per day. Puppies have short attention spans, so end your session on a

                    golden coat—reflective of its name—
                    originating from Scotland.<br> Known for their kind eyes, loyalty, and enthusiasm for life, the
                    golden
                    retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the United States. <br>Though historically bred
                    as
                    hunting dogs in the Scottish Highlands, goldens also make excellent family dogs.</p>

                <p style="color: aliceblue; font-size: 18px;">The Shih Tzu is a sturdy dog with a small muzzle and
                    normally has large dark brown eyes.<br> The Chinese have described their head shapes as "owl head"
                    and
                    "lion head", and their mouth as "frog mouths".<br> They have a soft and long double coat that will
                    tangle and mat easily if not brushed at least every 2 or 3 days.<br> A Shih Tzu should stand no more
                    than 26.7 cm (101⁄2") at the withers and with an ideal weight of 4.0 to 7.5kg (9 to 17 lb).<br>
                    Floppy
                    ears are covered with long fur, and the heavily furred tail is carried curled over the back.<br> The
                    coat may be of any color, though white and with blazes of grey are frequently seen.</p>

                    little dogs with big, furry trunks and tiny, stubby legs.<br> They are perhaps most well-known for being
                    the breed of choice of Queen Elizabeth.<br> In fact, she has owned more than 30 Corgi dogs during her
                    tenure as Queen, and recently just adopted another.<br>Corgis originated as working dogs, used to help
                    herd cattle and other livestock.<br> Today, they are mainly family pets, but they still have that
                    working dog spirit of the ancestors.</p>
